# Palmprint and Palmvein Recognition using Tensorflow
>This is a Tensorflow implementation of the palmprint/palmvein recognizer described in the paper ["Palmprint and Palmvein Recognition Based on DCNN and A New Large-Scale Contactless Palmvein Dataset"](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/10/4/78, ''). The project also uses ideas from the paper ["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832, '').
