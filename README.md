# Palmvein Recognition using Tensorflow
>This is a Tensorflow implementation of the palmvein recognizer. The project also uses ideas from the paper ["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832, '').

## Inspiration

>The code is heavily inspired by the ["FaceNet"](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet, '') implementation.
