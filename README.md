# Palmprint and Palmvein Recognition using Tensorflow
>This is a Tensorflow implementation of the palmprint/palmvein recognizer. The project also uses ideas from the paper ["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832, '').

## Inspiration

>The code is heavily inspired by the

## A Large-scale Contactless Palmvein Image Dataset


## Model
